# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project mostly adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.0] - 2020-02-05

### Changed
- Changed to use Tailwind 1.2’s new plugin definition syntax
- Flattened the theme configuration in order to support `theme.extend` which only allows extending top-level objects; in other words, the `linearGradients` object that contained nested `directions` and `colors` objects has been replaced by two top-level theme objects, `linearGradientDirections` and `linearGradientColors`; same for `radialGradients` (`radialGradientShapes`, `radialGradientSizes`, etc.), `conicGradients` (`conicGradientStartingAngles`, `conicGradientPositions`, etc.), `repeatingLinearGradients`, `repeatingRadialGradients`, and `repeatingConicGradients`

## [2.3.1] - 2019-09-01

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue when using nested object notation for gradient colors

## [2.3.0] - 2019-07-08

### Added
- Added conic gradient utilities, both standard and repeating (see `README` for more info)

## [2.2.0] - 2019-07-05

### Added
- Added a `bg-none` utility to remove gradients on larger screens (e.g. `bg-gradient-b-black sm:bg-none`)

## [2.1.0] - 2019-05-24

### Added
- Added repeating gradient utilities, both linear and radial (see `README` for more info)

### Changed
- Values that are optional in `linear-gradient()` and `radial-gradient()` (direction, shape, size, and position) are now omitted when the value is the same as the CSS-defined default value

## [2.0.1] - 2019-05-23

### Fixed
- Fixed an error when using keywords for colors such as `inherit` or `currentColor`

## [2.0.0] - 2019-05-17

### Added since 2.0.0-beta.2
- Added radial gradient utilities (see `README` for more info)

### Changed since 2.0.0-beta.2
- Renamed the `gradients` theme and variants keys to `linearGradients`
- Added support for global variants thanks to Tailwind’s `variants()` helper function

### Added since 1.x
- Tailwind 1.0.0 compatibility

### Changed since 1.x
- The plugin doesn’t accept a config object anymore; instead it finds what it needs in the `theme` and `variants` keys of your config (see `README` for more info)
- Responsive variants are now generated by default

### Fixed since 1.x
- Single-color gradients now generate a transparent `rgba()` version of the color instead of using the `transparent` keyword, which is interpreted as `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` (transparent black) by Safari and the CSS spec

## [2.0.0-beta.2] - 2019-04-04

### Fixed
- Single-color gradients now generate a transparent `rgba()` version of the color instead of using the `transparent` keyword, which is interpreted as `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` (transparent black) by Safari and the CSS spec

## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2019-04-04

### Added
- Tailwind 1.0.0 compatibility

### Changed
- The plugin doesn’t accept a config object anymore; instead it finds what it needs in the `theme` and `variants` keys of your config (see `README` for more info)
- Responsive variants are now generated by default

## [1.1.0] - 2018-11-05

### Added
- Added `directions` option (defaults to all sides and corners)
- Added proper tests with Jest

### Changed
- The classes that are generated by default are now shorter (`bg-gradient-t-[color]` instead of `bg-gradient-to-top-[color]`, etc.) but can be customized with the `directions` option

## [1.0.1] - 2018-08-14

### Fixed
- Fixed escaping in selectors generated by the plugin

## [1.0.0] - 2018-08-13
