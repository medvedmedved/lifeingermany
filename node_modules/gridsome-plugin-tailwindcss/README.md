# gridsome-plugin-tailwindcss

This plugin will add [Tailwind](http://tailwindcss.com) to your [Gridsome](http://gridsome.org) project.

## Who's This For?

If you want to set up Tailwind with the least amount of effort in a Gridsome
project, this is for you. If you want to lean in to the *Way of
Tailwind*&mdash;using `tailwind.config.js` or keep your CSS inside your Vue
files' style blocks&mdash;this is the plugin for you. If you want to have a
global CSS file and dump a bunch of crap in there, you'll wind up fighting this
plugin.

## Usage

I've gone ahead and automatically imported the default `tailwind.css` file from the Tailwind npm package. It's just add a CSS file that includes:

```postcss
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

You may be wondering, "Where do I add global CSS?!" Short answer, you don't.
Long answer, read the Tailwind docs on [creating plugins][plugins] and use
`tailwind.config.js` to add base styles and create components/utilities there.

**If you need to create `tailwind.config.js`, run `./node_modules/.bin/tailwind init` to create one.**

[plugins]: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins/#app

To use this plugin, run `npm install -D gridsome-plugin-tailwindcss` add the following to your `gridsome.config.js`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      use: 'gridsome-plugin-tailwindcss',
      /* These are the default options. You don't need to set any options to get going.
      options: {
        tailwindConfig: './some/file/js',
        purgeConfig: {},
        presetEnvConfig: {},
        shouldPurge: true,
        shouldImport: true,
        shouldTimeTravel: true
      }
      */
    }
  ]
}
```
If you don't supply a config file path, Tailwind defaults will be used.


The following PostCSS plugins are also included with this plugin:

## PurgeCSS

[PurgeCSS](https://www.purgecss.com/with-postcss) is enabled by default. If you'd like to disable it, pass `shouldPurge:
false` to the plugin options object.

## postcss-import

[postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import) included by default. Pass `shouldImport: false` to disable.

## postcss-preset-env

[postcss-preset-env](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env) included by default. Pass `shouldTimeTravel: false` to disable. You may also pass a config object to the plugin as `presetEnvConfig`.

With this one plugin, you should be ready to use Tailwind right away. Keep your
customization to `tailwind.config.js` whenever possible, but you can use the
full power of Tailwind (including `@apply`) in your Vue components when
necessary.
